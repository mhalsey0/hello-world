# hello-world
This is my first repo for using basic 'Hello World!' code to test
My name is Michael Halsey; however, I prefer Mike. I am 35 years old and taking my coding journey seriously for the first time. I started to learn how to code at 21. I purchased a textbook on how to program using C and tried teaching myself. I got stuck at memory management and gave up for several years. I revisted coding around 27 by starting a codecademy account and beginning their Python coding path. I made some progress but lost focus and abandoned that journey when my career started to take off. Now I am looking forward to a career change focused on coding and using my time to create something valuable.
